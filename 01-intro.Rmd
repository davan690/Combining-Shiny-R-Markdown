# Introduction {#intro}

R is a powerful programming language for statistical computing with many packages and tools.

The goal of this article is to outline some ways to combine Shiny & R Markdown.

We'll cover the main approaches below:

1. **Interactive documents**

2. **Including Markdown content in a Shiny app**

3. **Generating downloadable reports from Shiny apps**

4. **Embedding Shiny apps via their URLs in R Markdown output**

5. **Shiny components in rtutor**

## Generating downloadable reports from Shiny app

- It is often required after interacting with a Shiny application to download a report in HTML or PDF format. This can be done with knitr and rmarkdown. The app takes one input value, and passes it as a parameter to an .Rmd document, which is rendered (or knitted) into an HTML output file.

- Another way to generate a PDF is to pass in a value to output_format argument of rmarkdown::render(). It will also require pdflatex to be installed on your system.
