# Introduction {#intro}

R is a powerful programming language for statistical computing with many packages and tools.

The goal of this article is to outline some ways to combine Shiny & R Markdown.

We'll cover the main approaches below:

1. **Interactive documents**

2. **Including Markdown content in a Shiny app**

3. **Generating downloadable reports from Shiny apps**

4. **Embedding Shiny apps via their URLs in R Markdown output**

5. **Shiny components in rtutor**

## Interactive Documents - Overview
- R Markdown leverages Shiny at its core to make this possible. Add runtime: shiny to the document’s YAML header.

- As of Spring 17 - Shiny apps can’t currently be embedded into R Notebooks.

## Interactive Documents - an R Markdown file that contains Shiny components and can be an app or used within a report

- Types of Interactive Documents:
- 1. RMD Interactive Document/Report with Shiny components 
- Example: Demo by using File > New > RMarkdown > Shiny > Shiny Document
- 2. HTML presentations with Embed Shiny components
- Example: Demo by using File > New > RMarkdown > Shiny > Shiny Presentation
- *1/2 Note*. It is also possible to embed an entire shiny application within an R Markdown document using the `shinyAppDir` function or `shinyAppFile` or source

- 3. R Markdown report as Shiny app

## Include Markdown content in a Shiny app - Overview
- It's possible to include files with HTML, text, or Markdown content in a Shiny app.

- The includeMarkdown function requires the markdown package.

## Include Markdown content in a Shiny app - Example

## Generating downloadable reports from Shiny app
- It is often required after interacting with a Shiny application to download a report in HTML or PDF format. This can be done with knitr and rmarkdown. The app takes one input value, and passes it as a parameter to an .Rmd document, which is rendered (or knitted) into an HTML output file.

- Another way to generate a PDF is to pass in a value to output_format argument of rmarkdown::render(). It will also require pdflatex to be installed on your system.
